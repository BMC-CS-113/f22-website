**Due Thursday, October 20, before midnight**

The goals of this assignment are:

* Design and implement programs containing multiple functions
* Apply top-down design principles to building a larger program
* Work with loops, conditionals, and variables

= Minesweeper

In link:https://minesweeper.online[minesweeper], players try to uncover each cell of a NxM grid
without hitting any bombs. N represents the number of rows in the grid and 
M represents the number of columns.

When the game starts, the program will generate a board and show it to the user
with all cells hidden. When the user selects a cell, the game will reveal the
contents of the cell. If the cell has bombs in any of the 8 adjacent cells, the 
cell will show a count of the number of neighboring bombs. If no bombs are adjacent,
the cell is empty. If the cell contains a bomb, the game is over. If the user
uncovers all cells, the user wins!

We will build up our programs in two parts.

:secnums:
== Board

Write a program, `Board.java`, that generates and displays a NxM minesweeper board.
The user should specify the following parameters as _command line arguments_.

* the number of rows (integer)
* the number of cols (integer)
* the probability that a cell contains a bomb (double in range [0,1))

Requirements/Hints:

* You must use command-line arguments
* You should use a 2D array to store the board. We recommend using a 2D array of integers, where each cell contains the count of neighboring bombs. If the cell contains a bomb, you can use a special value, such as -1, to denote it.
* To decide whether a cell includes a bomb, use `Math.random` and test whether the value is less than the given probability.

We recommend that you organize your code to use functions for generating and displaying the board. 
You will re-use these functions in the next question.

class Board {
    public static void display(int[][] board) {
        // todo: display board to console
    }

    public static int[][] generate(int rows, int cols, double prob) {
        // todo: generate board with dimensions rows x cols 
        // todo: fill board with prob chance of containing a bomb
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // call generate and display
    }
}

== Game

Write a program, `Minesweeper.java`, that implements the game of minesweeper. Re-use your code from 
the previous question. You should also re-use your validation functions from last week 
to check for valid user input.

Below are several examples showing how the game should play:

* link:logs/minesweeper-output1.txt[User wins]
* link:logs/minesweeper-output2.txt[User loses]

Your output doesn't need to look exactly the same but it should be clean and easy to read.

*Your program should use command line arguments!*

=== Main Function

Your `main()` function should use the functions below to do the bulk of the work.  
  The general outline of the program is as follows:

. Print out a welcome message. You can do this in main, or define a function for it.
. Set up initial variables before entering the game loop. You will need at least two boards: one with the generated bombs and one that keeps track of which cells the user has uncovered already. 
. Set up your game loop (hint: use a while loop). Each time through the loop, the program will ask for a cell to uncover and update the board. 
. Print the output of the game. If the user selects a cell with the bomb, they lose. If the user uncovers all non-bomb cells, they win.

=== Design

Think about how to subdivide the features of the game into functions. Each function should implement a 
single, well-defined task. For example, we don't recommend you put your entire game loop into a function!
But we do recommend that you use functions to help abstract sub-tasks, for example,

* to validate input 
* to check whether the user has uncovered all non-bomb cells
* to display the current state of the board
* printing text with banners 

NOTE: You can define a 2D array of booleans to keep track of which cells the user has selected already.

= Extra challenge

Implement your own unique minesweeper game in `MyMinesweeper.java`. Be sure to point out to us 
your original ideas and features in your readme. Below are ideas

* Use StdDraw to display the board with graphics
* If the user selects an empty square, uncover all adjacent cells until you reach a non-empty cells.

= What to hand-in

. The programs, `Board.java` and `Minesweeper.java`, and if applicable, `MyMinesweeper.java`
. Make sure your program has a header containing your name, date, and purpose of the program
. A brief write-up containing your name, assignment number, and a few sentences about how long you 
spent on the assignment and any interesting bugs you solved. Be sure to highlight any 
customizations you made for your game!!

== How to hand-in

. Copy your files to your dropbox, into the folder called `A06`.
