== Coding guidelines

In addition to producing the correct output, in this assignment you are also asked to 
write code that is easy to read and understand. In particular, part of your score on this 
assignment will be determined by:

* Variable naming: Variables should have meaningful names that indicate what they represent, using full English words or common abbreviations, e.g. “wins” or “votes” instead of “w” or “vot”.
* Appearance:The code should be formatted so that indentation and spacing make it easy to understand which parts of the code are within the bodies of if-statements and loops. 

Additionally, there should be spacing between variables and operators to make it easy to read each individual line of code.
This is called *style* and is an essential requirement for producing clean, readable code. 
For example, a piece of code that determines the maximum value in an array called values should look something like this:

[source]
----
int  max = values[0];
for (int i = 1; i < values.length; i++) {
    if (values[i] > max) {
        max = values[i];
    }
}
System.out.println("Max is " + max); 
----

Not like this:

[source]
----
int  a=values[0];
for (int i=1;i<values.length;i++) {
if (values[i]>a) { 
a=values[i];
}
}
System.out.println("Max is "+a); 
----

Please speak with your TAs or instructor if you have any questions about style!

= Paper Fortune Teller 

Will you marry? Should you take that job? Back in the old days, we
turned to link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_fortune_teller[paper fortune
tellers] to answer these along with many other burning questions about our
lives. 

Write a program, `FortuneTeller.java`, that implements a paper fortune teller. 
Your fortune teller should implement the following algorithm:

1. Ask the user to select either red, blue, yellow, or green

2. If the number of characters in the selected color is even, ask the user to choose one of the following numbers: 1,2,5,6.
If the number of characters is odd, ask the user to choose one of the following numbers: 3,4,7,8

3. If the chosen number is even, ask the user to choose between the same numbers as step 2.
If the chosen number is odd, ask the user to choose between the other set of numbers.

4. Finally, give the user an answer based on the following table

.responses
1 It is certain.
2 Without a doubt.
3 Outlook good.
4 Reply hazy, try again.
5 Concentrate and ask again.
6 Better not tell you now.
7 My sources say no.
8 Don't count on it.

Below is an example

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **java FortuneTeller**
----

Requirements and tips:

* You must validate the user's input. For example, if they must enter either 1,2,5,6 and they enter "blue" or "0" or "100", the program should respond with a message and ask again. 


= Fibonacci

Write a program, `Fibonacci.java`, that stores the first N values of the Fibonacci 
sequence in an array and prints it out. Your program should take the number of values 
as a _command line argument_. Each value stem:[F_n] in the link:https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html[Fibonacci sequence] is equal to the sum of the previous two values. 
In other words,

[stem]
++++
F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}
F_2 = 1
F_1 = 1
++++

[source,subs="quotes"]
----
$ **java Fibonacci 10**
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55

$ **java Fibonacci 1**
1

$ **java Fibonacci 0**
----

Requirements:

* Your program should use comamnd line arguments
* Your program can assume the user enters a non-negative argument

== Before You Begin

Because this assignment focuses on keeping track of the number of occurrences of 
individual letters in the program input, we will be making heavy use of the Java 
char datatype, which was presented in Section 1.2 of your course textbook. 
Review this part of your textbook if you are not familiar with this datatype.

A Java *char* variable represents a single character, which can be a letter
like ‘a’ or ‘M’; a digit like ‘2’ or ‘8’; or punctuation like ‘+’ or ‘?’.

When working with letters, as we will do in this assignment, it is even
possible to do math with char variables, for instance:

[source]
----
char first = 'k';
char second = (char)(first + 3); 
StdOut.printf("%c", second);
----

This code will print
the letter ‘n’, since ‘n’ is three letters after ‘k’ in the alphabet, and the
“%c” format string means to treat the value as a char. Similarly, you could
have something like this:

[source]
----
char letter = 'g';
int value = letter - 'a';
StdOut.printf("%d", value); 
----

This code will print 6, since ‘g’ is six letters
after ‘a’. Be sure you understand this before starting, and ask your
TAs or Instructor or post a question on slack if you are not sure how this works!

== Count characters

The first step in building the histogram is to read the input text one
character at a time, and to keep track of and then display (to stdout) the
number of occurrences of each letter between ‘a’ and ‘z’. 

For instance, if the input text were “java yeah!”, the program should
indicate that the letter ‘a’ occurs three times and that the letters ‘e’,
‘h’, ‘j’, ‘v’, and ‘y’ each
occur once. It should ignore the blank space between “java” and “yeah!”, as
well as the ‘!’ character, since those are not letters. 

Your program should
display the number of occurrences for all 26 letters, even if a given letter
does not appear. For instance, in the above example, the output should look
like this:

[source]
----
a: 3 
b: 0 
c: 0 
d: 0 
e: 1 
. . . output omitted but you get the idea... 
x: 0 
y: 1 
z: 0 
----

For simplicity, you may assume that your program only
needs to keep track of lowercase letters, i.e. that any uppercase characters
in the input have already been converted to lowercase, and your program only
needs to track the 26 lowercase letters used in English.

The following hints
should help you with this part of the assignment:

* You can use StdIn.isEmpty() to determine whether or not there is more input text to read. 
* You can use StdIn.readChar() to read a single character from the input and store the character in a char variable. 
* Use a 26-element array of counts to keep track of number of occurrences of each letter. Do not define 26 different variables to store the number of occurrences of each letter!
* You should store the number of occurrences of the letter ‘a’ in index #0, the number of occurrences of ‘b’ in index #1, and so on. You can use the “math with char variables” advice from above to figure out the corresponding array index for each letter. 
* To determine whether a char variable holds a lowercase letter, you can determine whether it is in the range [‘a’, ‘z’] in the same way in which you would determine whether an int variable is in a certain numerical range by using comparison operators. 

To test your program with the default
source for stdin, i.e. the Terminal, then follow these steps:

. Run the program with the command `java-introcs LetterFrequency`
. Type characters into the Terminal. Don’t worry about putting spaces between them; your program should be able to read each character one at a time. Your program should only be counting the occurrences of lowercase letters, i.e. ‘a’ through ‘z’.
. When you are done entering characters, you can indicate that there are no more characters to read (so that StdIn.isEmpty() will return true) by typing Ctrl-D (that is, pressing the Control and D keys at the same time) if you are using a Mac, or Enter then Ctrl-Z then Enter if you are using Windows.
. Your program should then display the number of times you entered each character from ‘a’ to ‘z’. 

Once you have tested your program by entering characters
into the Terminal, try it with the text of “War and Peace”, which is
available in the file `tolstoy.txt`. Assuming that `tolstoy.txt` is in the same
directory as your Java source code, all you need to do is run the program
like this:

[source,subs=quotes]
----
java-introcs LetterFrequency < tolstoy.txt
----

Then you should see the
number of occurrences for each of the characters ‘a’ through ‘z’. Your
program should produce the following output:

[source]
----
a: 204416 
b: 34371 
c: 60658 
d: 117751 
e: 313007 
f: 54504 
g: 50907 
h: 166515 
i: 172640 
j: 2485 
k: 20282 
l: 96032 
m: 61282 
n: 183126 
o: 191487 
p: 44717 
q: 2319 
r: 146889 
s: 162125 
t: 224506 
u: 64917 
v: 26787 
w: 58928 
x: 4032 
y: 45936 
z: 2386 
----

Be sure you complete this part before moving on to Part 2!

== Scale values

At this point, we know the number of occurrences of each lowercase letter,
but before we can draw the histogram, we need to scale the values so that the
letter that occurs the most has a value of 1.0, and the other letters’ values
are scaled accordingly.

For instance, using the example of “War and Peace,”
the letter ‘e’ occurs 313,007 times, which is the most. So we scale the value
for ‘e’ to 1.0. 

Then we determine the value for each of the other letters by
dividing by 313,007, such that ‘a’ gets a value of 204,416 / 313,007 = 0.653,
since ‘a’ occurs 65.3% as much as ‘e’, and so on.

Modify yourLetterFrequency
program so that it scales the values for each letter based on the number of
occurrences of the letter that appears the most, and then prints out each
letter ‘a’ through ‘z’ and its new, scaled value to three digits of
precision, i.e. three digits after the decimal point. 

For instance, when
running the program with “War and Peace” as the input, the output for this
part should be as follows:

[source]
----
a: 0.653 
b: 0.110 
c: 0.194 
d: 0.376 
e: 1.000 
f: 0.174 
g: 0.163 
h: 0.532 
i: 0.552 
j: 0.008 
k: 0.065 
l: 0.307 
m: 0.196 
n: 0.585
o: 0.612 
p: 0.143 
q: 0.007 
r: 0.469 
s: 0.518 
t: 0.717 
u: 0.207 
v: 0.086 
w: 0.188 
x: 0.013 
y: 0.147 
z: 0.008 
----

Be sure you complete this part before moving on to Part 3!

== Draw a histogram

Now that we know the relative/scaled values for the
number of occurrences of each letter, we can use the StdDraw library to draw
the histogram and represent these values visually.

Our histogram will consist
of a rectangle for each letter, going left to right ‘a’ through ‘z’, with the
height of each letter being equal to the relative/scaled value calculated in
Part 2.

To draw a rectangle using this library, you can
call 

[source]
----
StdDraw.rectangle(x, y, r1, r2) 
----

where:

* x is the x-axis coordinate of the
center of the rectangle
* y is the y-axis coordinate of the center of the
rectangle
* r1 the x-axis distance from the center of the rectangle to a
vertical side, i.e. half the width 
* r2 is y-axis distance from the center of
the rectangle to a horizontal side, i.e. half the height.

Recall that the
default coordinate system in the StdDraw library is [0.0, 1.0] on both the x-
and y-axes. For our purposes, this is fine for the y-axis because the
relative/scaled values from Part 2 are all in [0.0, 1.0] anyway, and will
represent the height of each rectangle. However, since we will have 26
rectangles, we can rescale the x-coordinates to [0.0, 26.0] using
`StdDraw.setXscale(0, 26)` so that the width of each rectangle is 1 and not
1/26. This will make the math a little easier.Using the above, we can now
describe how to draw the rectangle for the ith letter (starting from 0, which
is ‘a’):

* x is i + 0.5; this is so that the x-coordinate of the center of the
‘a’ rectangle is 0.5, the x-coordinate of the center of the ‘b’ rectangle is
1.5, and so on.
* y is 0.5 times the letter’s scaled value (from Part 2)
* r1 is
0.5, since this is half the width 
* r2 is 0.5 times the letter’s scaled value
(from Part 2), since this is half the height.

Modify your LetterFrequency
program so that it uses StdDraw to draw a rectangle for each lowercase letter
as described above. Your program output should look something like the
picture shown below
